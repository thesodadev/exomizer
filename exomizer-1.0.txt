Exomizer 1.0
------------

What is it?

  Exomizer is a cross-cruncher that runs on win32 or Linux as a command-line
  tool, but processes and generates files for the c64 computer.

   1) It is a file-compressor that compresses c64 files.
   2) It can produce stand-alone self-decompressing c64-files.
   3) It can produce files for both "in memory" or "from disk" decompression.
   3) It handles rle-sequences well, no packer is necessary.
   4) It's stand-alone decompressor can decompress $0400-$ffff.


Why is it called exomizer?

  More than ten years ago, I made some packers for the c64 that were named
  [groupname]mizer depending on which group I was a member of at the time.
  Since I'm not a member of any group now and it is a cross cruncher I
  figured 'exo' was the perfect prefix. The 'mizer' suffix I just kept for
  nostalgic reasons.


What sets this program apart from similar programs like PuCrunch?

  This program has been designed with ONLY the compression rate in mind. No
  compromises has been made in the effort to achieve the highest compression
  rates possible. As a result of this Exomizer has some drawbacks:

   1) it may use up to 50MB of internal memory for worst case files.
   2) it may take several minutes to compress a file on a modern PC.

  On the other hand it produces shorter files than any c64 file compressor I
  know of.


Are you releasing the source code?

  It is available.


Is it possible to use hexadecimal numbers for load and start adresses?

  Yes, use a 0x prefix, like 0xc600.


How much overhead does the builtin decruncher add to a file?

  These numbers compares resulting file sizes when crunching a file with the -s
  flag and crunching it with the -l flag. 

  Files with [load adress < $074E] will get 293 bytes larger.
  Files with [$074E <= load adress < $084E] will get 278 bytes larger.
  Files with [$084E <= load adress] will get 272 bytes larger.


What memory adresses does the decruncher clobber?

  Except for the adresses covered by the file itself $0801-$XXXX, the
  decruncher also clobbers the following adresses:

  Eight zeropage adresses are used: $a7, $ae-$af, $fb-$ff.
  The decruncher copies 186 bytes of itself to the stack at $0100-$01ba.
  The tapebuffer is used for tables, 156 bytes in total at $0334-$03d0.
  
  If the start adress of the decrunched data is lower than $0817 then the
  decruncher will clobber the memory from [(the start adress) - $30] to $0801.
  This space is used as a safety buffer.

  If the start adress of the decrunched data is between $0817 and $084D then
  the decruncher will clobber the memory from $07E7 to $0801. This space
  is used as a safety buffer.

  If the start adress of the decrunched data is $084E or higher then no extra
  space will be clobbered.
 
  The exodecrunch.s decruncher defaults to using the same zeropage adresses
  as the stand alone decruncher. It also uses a 156 byte tablespace. Both
  the table area and the zeropage adresses can easily be relocated.


How do I use the decruncher in the exodecrunch sourcecode?

  You simply call jsr decrunch_file, but first you must have implemented a
  suitable get_byte routine for it. The decruncher has only a simple
  get_byte as an example. If you want to decrunch from file you have to
  write the file handling routines yourselves. See the exodecrunch.s
  for more info.


Some Performance numbers:

  These tests are made on a AMD duron 700MHz. the byteboiler+rle sizes for
  the delenn.bin sheridan.bin and ivanova.bin has been taken from the home-
  page of pucrunch. I could not get them so small myself and I really want
  to show the best possible figures for any cruncher.

who made it?

    My name is Magnus Lind.
    I am reachable by email: magli143@telia.com


What else have you made?

    I have previously made some native packers for the c64 and an iffl-
    system, but that was at least ten years ago or so.

    The iffl system has been used recently by Nostalgia in some of their
    retro cracks. This is funny, because I have NO idea how they have gotten
    it. It was never released to the public and I haven't been able to find
    it on the net. (Not that I mind them using it.)
