
Exomizer 2.0 beta1 released (no source code and no docs yet).

NEW FEATURES:

o  New target independant binary, exoraw, that features:
   1) Crunches plain files instead of .prg files.
   2) Crunches forward or backwards instead of just backwards.
   3) Also decrunches.
   4) Handles files larget than 64k. Sizes below 1MB is now possible to crunch.
      It handles the complete canterbury and calgary corpora just fine.
   5) Comes with two different C-source decrunchers, one thread safe forward
      pull decruncher and one low-level backward push decruncher perfect to
      base an assembler port on.

o  Totally rewitten handling of the sfx decruncher in exomizer:
   1) Several different decrunch effects to chose from.
   2) Configurable for ram-only exit.
   3) Can start basic programs properly with built in trampoline by using the
      command 'sfx basic'
   3) The decruncher code is assembled on the fly for maximum flexibility by an
      embedded assembler.
   4) Will adapt the decruncher to include only features used by the compressed
      stream to keep the size down.
   5) Now also supports the c128 and the vic20 (in several configurations).

o  The cruncher now has an escape mechanism that detects and handles sequences
   of uncrunchable data, literal sequences, much better than before.

o  The level mode of exomizer now crunches each infile separately and appends
   them to the outfile instead of merging them together like the -r mode did
   before. The new behaviour is much more useful for level usage.

FEATURES STILL TO DO BEFORE PROPER RELEASE:

o  Sfx decruncher in exomizer:
   1) Handle the vic20 target better with regards to memory holes.

o  There is no decruncher 6502 asm source that handles the new literal
   sequences yet. Fortunately, these are almost never used for normal data so
   using the -c flag to order exomizer not to generate them is not a big loss.

o Update the usage descriptions properly.

The exomizer binary now uses a slightly different command syntax:
old:                                    new:
------------------                      -----------------------------
exomizer -ssys <infile>                 exomizer sfx sys <infile>
exomizer -s$1234 <infile>               exomizer sfx $1234 <infile>
exomizer -r <infile>                    exomizer level <infile>
exomizer <infile>                       exomizer mem -lnone <infile>
exomizer -l$1234 <infile>               exomizer mem -l$1234 <infile>
exomizer -lauto  <infile>               exomizer mem <infile>

The sfx decruncher effect and ram config on exit is selected by defining symbols to the assembler on the command line:

To use ram config on exit add the following flag:
 -Di_ram_on_exit=1

To select one of the four decruncher effects add this flag (0 <= n <= 3):
 -Di_config_effect=n

To have the effect updated faster add this flag:
 -Di_fast_effect=1

The possible effects to chose from are:
-1: no effect at all.
0: traditional lower right screen corner flashing (default).
1: border flash based on the value of the accumulator.
2: border flash based on the value of the x-register.
3: border flash based on the value of the y-register.
