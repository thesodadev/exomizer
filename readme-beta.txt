Hi there beta tester.

the program should be quite self explainatory, just run it with the -? option.
The exodecrunch.s is a asm sourcefile that at least assembles with the ca65 assembler
included in the cc65 compiler package. The decruncher sourcefile is based on the one used
in the sfx-routines but with an easily exchangeable get_byte routine. It may contain silly
bugs, but they should be easy to spot.
