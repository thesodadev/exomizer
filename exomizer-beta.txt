Exomizer beta

This is a beta test version, please don't spread it
It may contain embarassing bugs. Contact me instead.

What is it?

  Exomizer is a cross-cruncher that runs on win32 or Linux as a command-line
  tool but processes and generates files for the c64 computer.

   1) It is a file-compressor that compresses c64 files.
   2) It can produce stand-alone self-decompressing c64-files.
   3) It can produce files for both "in memory" or "from disk" decompression.
   3) It compresses rle-sequences well.
   4) It's stand-alone decompressor can decompress $0400-$ffff

Why is it called exomizer?

  More than ten years ago, I made some packers for the c64 that were named
  [groupname]mizer depending on which group I was a member in at the time.
  Since I'm not a member of any group now and it is a cross cruncher i
  figured exo was a perfect prefix and mizer is a suffix I am/was used to
  using.

What sets this program apart from similar programs like PuCrunch?

  This program has been designed with ONLY the compression rate in mind. No
  compromises has been made in the effort to achieve the highest compression
  rates possible. As a result of this Exomizer has some drawbacks:

   1) it may use up to 50MB of internal memory for worst case files.
   2) it may take several minutes to compress a file on a modern PC.

  On the other hand it produces shorter files than any c64 file compressor I
  know of.


Are you releasing the source code?

  I'm considering this.


Some Performance numbers:
  These tests are made on a AMD duron 700MHz. the byteboiler+rle sizes for
  the delenn.bin sheridan.bin and ivanova.bin has been taken from the home-
  page of pucrunch. I could not get them so small myself and I really want
  to show the best possible figures for any cruncher.

who made it?

    My name is Magnus Lind.
    I am reachable by email: magli143@telia.com

What else have you made?

    I have previously made some native packers for the c64 and an iffl-
    system, but that was at least ten years ago or so.

    The iffl system has been used recently by Nostalgia in some of their
    retro cracks. This is funny, because I have NO idea how they have gotten
    it. It was never released to the public and I haven't been able to find
    it on the net. (Not that I mind them using it.)

    A side note:
     My packer was totally dissed by skyflash in the introtext to hackpack3
     or so. Those were the days. :)
